The goals of the app I developed was to provide the user with a way to log into their golds gym, as well as track your workouts there and see any changes in scheduling. The screens that were necessary were a login screen, a home screen, and a screen that would let you opt in or out of sms message notifications. I kept users in mind by constantly asking myself throughout the design if I would find it easy to use. While I myself may have bias towards my own work, I have used many of these apps so I have a good idea of what will do well. The process of coding was to first work on form, and then function. Since people will be looking at the face of the app and not the coding, it is important to put a lot of energy and time into how the app looks. It is important that your app nice to look at as well as functional. The biggest challenge I had to overcome was making the app work. There were a lot of moving parts, so the debugging process was very arduous.
